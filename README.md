## 1 Problem:
In today's world where food recipes are taking over the social media platforms, 
it can be hard to aggregate all your favorite recipes across blogs and apps into one place. It can also be tough to find out more
information about the ingredients in a specific recipe or find good pairings with a certain dish. People love knowing what their 
friends or family are trying out, and it can get overwhelming to constantly be in touch with them to find out these details. 


### 1.1 Users:

#### General (Customers):
The main users of the app are people that consume the content provided by the website. It could be anyone from regular users to content creators.
Users can create a profile, like and share recipes that they find on the website. They can also find more information about certain ingredients used within the recipes. Users can also follow other users and by 
doing so create a feed on their timeline of the recipes people have liked and/or shared.   

#### Admin: 
The admins of the website act as moderators and monitor the content being shared on the platform. 
They manage the user information and can remove users should the need arise. They also have access to 
certain pages that are not accessible to other users of the website.

## 2 Solving the problem:
Our website aims to solve the problem mentioned above by creating a website that combines the two important features: recipe/ingredient 
search, and the ability to share/save recipes to their feed which can be followed by other users. It acts as a central place for people who are interested in learning 
about recipes, ingredients, and food pairings.
